### **Wegovy vs. Ozempic: A Quick Overview**  

Both Wegovy and Ozempic are prescription medications that help with weight loss by mimicking GLP-1, a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar levels.

- **Wegovy** is specifically approved for weight loss and helps users feel fuller for longer, leading to reduced calorie intake.  
- **Ozempic**, while primarily for managing Type 2 diabetes, has proven effective for weight loss as well.

While both options are effective, they come with potential side effects like nausea, diarrhea, and bloating. Additionally, their high cost and need for medical supervision can be a barrier for some individuals.
